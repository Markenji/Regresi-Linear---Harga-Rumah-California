# Linear Regression with California Housing Dataset

This project demonstrates how to apply linear regression using the California Housing dataset with scikit-learn. The code provides an example of loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, and performing cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **California Housing Dataset**, which contains information about median house prices in various districts in California. The target variable is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars.

### Features:

- `MedInc`: Median income in block group.
- `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group.
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household.
- `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household.
- `Population`: Block group population.
- `AveOccup`: Average number of household members.
- `Latitude`: Block group latitude.
- `Longitude`: Block group longitude.

### Target:

- `Price`: Median house value for California districts, in hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## Installation

You will need Python 3.x and the following libraries to run the code:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

To install the required libraries, run:
